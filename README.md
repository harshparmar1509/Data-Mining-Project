Title: Eye saccading movements by frame contents

Brief Description: It isn't surely known what manner of thinking and methodology people experience when they take a gander at and examine pictures. Our decision to look at specific areas in a picture and afterward hop, or saccade, to different areas may be propelled by either the organization of the picture itself or rather by brain signals autonomous of the picture. In this project, we wish to detect features in images that motivate changes in the eye of the viewer.
