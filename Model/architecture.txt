Method:
Input - Video Frames cropped around a central point of fixation into a convolutional neural
network 
Output - The network outputs a distribution of probabilities assigned to a 4x4 grid corresponding to sections of
the image, indicating the likelihood of the viewers gaze saccading to that position if they are currently fixating
upon the given point.

Data preprocessing:
1. extract saccade 
2. Produce Images

Model:
